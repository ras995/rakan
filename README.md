Movie: The Mask
The Movie was a short simple film that will hopefully raise awareness on the importance of medical masks especially during the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The Website was made to present the movie, and the credits.
ŸèTo maintain the COVID Mask awareness theme, Masks were used to replace pictures of the actors, and a "club penguin nurse" was added to the bottom corner of every page.
The different color Masks used in the credits section represent the three actors in the film and the masks they wore.
I was hoping to change the bankground to a picture of a hospital to further mantain the theme but I found that the "club penguin nurse" was better in terms of the overall look of the website, as the hospital background didn't mix well with the different elements of the website.
